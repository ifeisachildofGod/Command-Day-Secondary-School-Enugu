        Since our inception in 1998, our mandate is and has always been very clear, to educat and instill discipline and wisdom on these children whom we take as our own.<br><br>
        From the very beginning our motto has been <strong>Discipline and knowledge</strong> and that to the highest degree and emphasis on the phrase. We have not spared the rod and our children (as far as we are concerned) have not spoiled in the slightest.<br><br>
        We have strived and succeded to acheve a reputation unmatched as one of the best, if not the best government owned secondary schools in Enugu and Nigeria at large. Our mission will always be to continue in our successes and set new standards for the spuplic sector schooling in Nigeria.<br><br>
        We want to make Nigerians wise, strong and disciplined again as the cultural and societal norms has further deteriorated and eroded due to bad western incluence. But our overall goal and that of our students, staff and Nigeria at large is to <strong><span class="text-5">Make Nigeria Great Again</span></strong>
